Web Programming with Python and Javascript

Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
Your task in this project is to expand on this site, creating your own front end for Google Search, as by exploring Googleâ€™s interface to identify what GET parameters it expects and adding the necessary HTML and CSS to your website

This was Project 0 of HarvardX's CS50w course, and served as a quick refresher on working with HTML forms and styling using Sass.
